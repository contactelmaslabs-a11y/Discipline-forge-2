You are a senior full-stack mobile app developer and UI/UX designer. Build a stunning, premium-looking habit/discipline tracker web app called "Discipline Forge ®" using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks except optional CDN for confetti/animations). The app must be 100% PWA-ready, offline-capable, and publishable on Google Play via WebIntoApp/WebAPK.
Core Features (Must Implement Perfectly):- Users can create unlimited custom tasks with:  • Name (e.g., "Gym", "Read 30 mins", "Call Mom")  • Frequency: Daily / Weekly / Specific days (Mon–Sun toggle)  • Optional time reminder (e.g., 7:00 AM, 9:00 PM)  • Optional motivational quote or personal "Why" note- Beautiful dashboard showing:  • Today's tasks with big checkmark buttons  • Current streak fire emoji for each task  • Weekly heatmap calendar (like GitHub contributions)  • Discipline Score: Giant animated percentage ring (0–100%) showing "How disciplined you were this week/month"- Discipline Percentage Calculation (Advanced Logic):  • Daily tasks = 1 point each if completed before midnight  • Weekly tasks = divided equally across selected days  • Score = (completed tasks / total expected tasks) × 100  • Smooth Confetti explosion + motivational message when reaching 80%, 90%, 100%- Smart Notifications (Web Push + In-App):  • Use Web Notifications API + Service Worker  • If a daily task is not marked done by set reminder time → send notification: "Don't break your streak! Complete 'Gym' now?"  • Second reminder 1 hour before midnight if still pending- Premium Dark + Light themes with glassmorphism and neon accents- Streak leader: Hall of Fame showing longest streaks ever- Data saved forever using IndexedDB + localStorage (never loses data)- Export data as beautiful PDF summary (monthly report)- Motivational quotes on home screen + achievement badges (Warrior, Legend, God Mode at 30/100/365 days)
